# 🚀 Startup Booster: Entrepreneurial Potential Predictor

**Startup Booster** is a data-driven Shiny application designed to identify entrepreneurial potential among students. Built upon the **Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) 2021** dataset, it utilizes machine learning to predict entrepreneurial intentions and provides personalized, explainable feedback (SHAP) to help users understand their specific boosters and blockers.

## 🔭 Project Overview

This project aims to bridge the gap between students and university startup centers (like the DIT StartUp Campus). By analyzing demographic data, psychological traits, and economic context, the tool:

1.  **Predicts** the likelihood of a student starting a business in the next 3 years.
2.  **Visualizes** key drivers using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values.
3.  **Recommends** actionable steps based on the user's specific "hemmnisse" (barriers) and boosters.

The interface is built with **R Shiny** and uses a custom wizard-style UI to ensure a seamless user experience.

## 📚 Data Sources & Documentation

The data and documentation were obtained from the official **Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM)** consortium.

### 1. Primary Dataset
The raw dataset is included in this repository at `data/raw/`.
*   **File:** `GEM2021APSGlobalIndividualLevelData_15Feb2023.sav`
*   **Source:** GEM Consortium Data Sets
*   **Link:** [https://www.gemconsortium.org/data/sets](https://www.gemconsortium.org/data/sets)

### 2. Variable Descriptions
We utilize the 2015 codebook as a primary reference for variable themes, as the core definitions are largely consistent across years.
*   **File:** `gem-2015-aps-individual-level-variable-descriptions...xlsx`
*   **Source:** GEM Wiki Codebooks
*   **Link:** [https://www.gemconsortium.org/about/wiki#collapse-wiki-codebooks](https://www.gemconsortium.org/about/wiki#collapse-wiki-codebooks)

### 3. Supplementary Material
Additional context and definitions can be found in the `./supplementary_material` folder:
*   **`FeatureDescriptions.txt`**: Detailed breakdown of features selected for the model.
*   **`Global_Entrepreneurship_Analytics_Using_GEM_Data.pdf`**: Reference methodology for GEM analytics.
*   **Presentations**: Historical context via included `.pptx` files.

## 🛠 Prerequisites & Installation

Ensure you have R installed (preferably R 4.0+). You will need the following R packages:

```r
install.packages(c(
  "shiny", "tidyverse", "tidymodels", "data.table", "haven", 
  "ranger", "xgboost", "glmnet", "themis", "fastshap", 
  "missForest", "vip", "doFuture", "doParallel", "scales", 
  "sf", "rnaturalearth", "rnaturalearthdata"
))
```

---

## ⚡ Workflow & Usage

Although the raw data is included, you must run the pipeline to process it for the application.

### 1. Run the Data Pipeline
This script converts the `.sav` file to CSV, handles missing values (MissForest), and filters for the student demographic.
```r
source("scripts_production/01_data_pipeline.R")
```

### 2. Train the Model
Trains the configured Random Forest model, determines the optimal decision threshold based on sensitivity/specificity tradeoffs, and generates SHAP background data.
```r
source("scripts_production/02_train_final_model.R")
```
*Output: Artifacts will be saved to `output_production/`.*

### 3. Launch the Application
Start the Shiny GUI.
```r
shiny::runApp("app.R")
```

## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Processing
*   **Target Population:** Students (18-64 years old).
*   **Imputation:** We utilize **MissForest** (Non-parametric Random Forest Imputation) to handle missing values, as simple median imputation ignores complex demographic relationships.
*   **Survey Logic:** We engineered features like `Mindset_Asked` to account for the GEM survey's split-sample design (Missing at Random).

### Modeling
*   **Algorithms:** We benchmarked Logistic Regression, Random Forest (Ranger), and XGBoost.
*   **Optimization:** Bayesian Optimization was used for hyperparameter tuning.
*   **Class Imbalance:** Handled via SMOTE and Class Weights.
*   **Selection:** The **Random Forest** with Manual Class Weights was selected for production due to its robustness and balance of Sensitivity/Specificity.

### Explainable AI
*   **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** The app does not just output a "Yes/No". It calculates the contribution of every input (e.g., Fear of Failure, Gender, Skills) to the prediction.
*   **FastSHAP:** A computationally efficient implementation is used to generate real-time explanations within the Shiny app.

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

The application features a custom CSS design (`ui_utils.R`) deviating from standard Shiny Bootstrap aesthetics to create an engaging experience for students:

*   **Wizard Interface:** A hidden-tab implementation creates a seamless, step-by-step questionnaire flow.
*   **Segmented Controls:** Custom JavaScript and CSS inputs replace standard radio buttons, offering larger target areas for ease of use on touch devices.
*   **Visual Feedback:** Results are presented via color-coded bar charts (Green for boosters, Red for inhibitors), making the SHAP output instantly understandable.
